# Pixel Perfect Mockups

Development teams work best when there's clear communication between all roles. This afternoon we'll practice team mechanics by building a simple web page. In groups of three, you'll use a landing page of a site of your choosing and re-create it visually as pixel perfect as you can. 

Some resources:
 - [Land Book](https://land-book.com)
 - [Landing Folio](http://www.landingfolio.com/)
 - [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/search?q=landing+page&s=latest)

## Rules
Once you've chosen a template/mockup, the teams will break into three positions:

  - One person will explain the page to their team but will not be able to see the project until the page has been built. 
  - The second person will be able to view both the design and development, but can't drive either position.
  - The last person will be drive the main development but will not be able to view the design.

### Level 1
Choose a landing page, team member roles, and begin creating the project framework.

### Level 2:
Layout the page without a theme, by only creating the grid system, text, and images.

### Level 3:
Begin styling the page to match the mockup.

### Level 4:
Add additional functionality like SEO, mobile-specific styles, or animations.

### Level 5:
Create an about page using the same styles to show your work. Upload it to Github and Heroku.

## Conclusion
The specification is otherwise open-ended to the implementation of the page set-up.

* You may choose the form of user interface (e.g. React, Vanilla JS, Vanilla HTML/CSS).
